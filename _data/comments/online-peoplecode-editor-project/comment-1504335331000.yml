  Really interesting project, Colton. I wonder if using a contenteditable
  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable)
  element would make it easier to format the code nicely, e.g. insert whitespace
  and newlines in the correct place. No promises, but I may play with that
  sometime and see if I can get the Sublime Text PeopleTools syntax highlighter
  (https://github.com/Jatz/PeopleCodeTools) to work in the browser.
