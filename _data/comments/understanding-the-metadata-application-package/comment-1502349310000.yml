  I am unfortunately not sure how to reference App Engine PeopleCode.  I noticed
  in your code that you are not making use of the App Engine Action key
  (Key:Class_AEAction).  This key, combined with the others, could be the proper
  key combination to reference App Engine PeopleCode, but I am not certain.  


  If you figure out how to reference App Engine PeopleCode, then please share.
