  Thank you for sharing your experiences, Curtis.  I have done some spot
  checking on the VERSION values of some of the objects that I have updated
  using %metadata, but never thought to ensure the integrity of fields like
  LASTUPDDTTM and LASTUPDOPRID.  Good to know that this is working for you.
