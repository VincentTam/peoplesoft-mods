  Very helpful!  I did find that the breadcrumbs don't generate if you are going
  from a fluid homepage, clicking on a tile, then going to a component. It only
  generates as you navigate from the Root of the menu.  Would be cool to have
  that auto-generate the menu of where the underlying component in the Tile
  resides.  Anyway, thank you for sharing this!
