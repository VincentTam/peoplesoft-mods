  I ran into this issue as well.  You will need to navigate to: PeopleTools ->
  Utilities -> Administration-> PeopleTools Options.  On this page you will need
  to change the "Base Time Zone" field to the correct timezone. I do not believe
  that this requires an app bounce, so the change should work immediately.
