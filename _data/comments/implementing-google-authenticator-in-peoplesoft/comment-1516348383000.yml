  Hi Raj,  I found the PeopleSoft Pluggable Encryption Technology to be too
  cumbersome to get working with this solution.  Instead, I switched to using a
  JavaScript-based TOTP algorithm that can be ran using the delivered Java on
  the Application Server.  Using Java to run JavaScript in PeopleCode is a great
  technique to get get around the technical limitations of the PeopleCode
  language.  The best part of this technique is that there are no additional App
  Server Java dependencies required to do this.


  I plan to do another post on this topic in the near future.
