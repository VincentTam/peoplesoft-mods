  Hello Sree.  Good to know that you solved your Nexmo communication issue. As
  for how did I create the app designer project, I assume you are referring to
  how I created the necessary objects needed to consume a REST web service from
  PeopleSoft?  There are some different ways to consume 3rd party web services
  in PeopleSoft and this example uses document-based messaging with Integration
  Broker for the communication.  To do this, I had to create the following in
  the PeopleSoft PIA:


  Documents

  Messages

  Service

  Service operation

  PeopleCode Program


  There are some really good examples on creating the necessary objects for REST
  web services in PeopleSoft.  Here is <a

  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">another by Jose Ponce</a>.  The only thing that
  you want to do differently is uncheck the “Is Provider” checkbox when you are
  creating the service since you are consuming a service and not providing one. 
  Here are a couple of PeopleBook references that may be helpful as well:
