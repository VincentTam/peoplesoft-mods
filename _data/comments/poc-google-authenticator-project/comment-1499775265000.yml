  Hi Jared.  After importing the project and assigning the permissions, the only
  configured page that is needed is the delivered “Manage Related Content
  Service” page.  The path to this page is Main Menu > PeopleTools > Portal >
  Related Content Service > Manage Related Content Service.  Here you will map
  the PSM_ENFORCE_GAUTH service to the Component(s) that you want to enable 2FA
  on.  This should be the only configuration that is needed to get this to work.

  Please let me know if this answers your question.  Also let me know if you are
  having any issues getting this project to work.  I’d be more than glad to help
  you get it working.
