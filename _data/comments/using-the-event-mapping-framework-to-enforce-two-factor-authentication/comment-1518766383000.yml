  I have not experienced event mapping code not getting invoked on Components
  with search records.  The only issue I ever experienced with event mapping
  code not firing was due to the bug described in My Oracle Support Doc ID
  2171391.1, but this bug was fixed in PeopleTools 8.55.11.  Sasank did a great
  write up of this bug on his blog here:
  https://pe0ples0ft.blogspot.com/2016/10/emf-hello-world-and-quirks.html.


  You may be experience this bug if you are on a dot release before 8.55.11.  If
  you are on 8.55.11+, then I would suggest opening a case with My Oracle
  Support and hopefully they can help you out.
