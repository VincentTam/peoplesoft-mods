  This is a really good question.  I think you should be able to pass search
  record field values as GET parameters in the URL to bypass search pages.  If
  this is the case, you might be able to do the following to bypass the search
  page after a successful 2FA challenge.


  Do the following in the PreBuild event that the 2FA code is running on before
  you redirect the user to perform 2FA:


  1.  Use the %Component variable to query the metadata tables to determine the
  names of the search record fields for the given component.

  2.  Parse the %Request object and extract the POSTed search record field
  values using the search record field names obtained in the previous step.

  3.  When generating the URL to redirect back to after a successful 2FA
  challenge,  include the search record field name-value pairs as GET parameters
  in the URL.


  If this does indeed work, you need to be weary of the values that you are
  passing in as GET parameters.  Unlike POSTed values, GET parameter values tend
  to linger around for long periods in places such as server logs and browser
  history.  This can be a potential security concern for search records that
  contain sensitive input values.  If you pass these types of values as GET
  parameters, then there is a greater chance that these values can be stored in
  places that you do not want.
