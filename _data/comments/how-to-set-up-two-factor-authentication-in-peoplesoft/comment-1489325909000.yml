  It is possible that the domain that the PSM_2FA_TOKEN cookie is being written
  for is incorrect.  You can look at the PeopleCode that sets the cookie's
  domain.  I believe that the code is currently referencing the authentication
  domain that is specified on the web profile.  Make sue that the domain that
  the cookie is being written for is the same domain as the other application
  cookies such as the PS_TOKEN.
