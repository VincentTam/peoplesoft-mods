message: "Hi Colton, \r\nThank you for sharing this valuable information. I am running in to this exact same issue. I tried to open the HTML object in App Designer, copied the script content and tried to create an HTML object thru PIA. I still get the line breaks. Is it because i copied the javascript from app designer HTML ? Is it possible to copy it from database table without getting the line breaks ? \r\nYour help is very much appreciated. \r\nThank you"
