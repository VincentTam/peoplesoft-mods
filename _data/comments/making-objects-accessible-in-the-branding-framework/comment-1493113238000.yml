  Hey Sasank!  Thanks for sharing the related article.  Hopefully we will see
  some improvements to the Branding Framework in the 8.56 Tools that will make
  managing these objects a bit easier.  

  Itâ€™d be really be nice to see them incorporate an enhanced PIA JavaScript
  editor like the one you demoed at Alliance.  That was a very interesting
  solution that you came up with.
