message: "I don't have an API that returns `4XX`/`5XX` statuses with response message content to test this on.  If you are finding that the response contains empty content for `4XX`/`5XX` statuses, then it is possible that IB is \"eating\" content for these scenarios. This could be a bug or by design.  \r\n\r\nYou can try asking this question in the [PeopleTools MOS Community](https://community.oracle.com/community/support/peoplesoft/peopletools_-_psft) to see if any of the experts have opinions or solutions for this issue."
