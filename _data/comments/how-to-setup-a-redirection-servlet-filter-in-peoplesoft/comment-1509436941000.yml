  This approach seems like it should work.  You would have to configure the
  filter for all possible resources ("/psc/*" url-pattern) and the filter would
  check each request for a valid token.  If a valid token is present in the
  request, then simply call chain.doFilter(...). If a token is not present in
  the request, then you would call response.sendRedirect(...) to redirect to the
  custom user profile page.  The biggest gotcha is to ensure that the issued
  token is not easily forge-able.
