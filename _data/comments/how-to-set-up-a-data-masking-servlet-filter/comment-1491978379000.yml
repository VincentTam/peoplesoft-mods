  There is a clickable link at the beginning of this post (labeled "CLICK HERE")
  that contains all of the source code to implement the solution that I have
  demonstrated in this post.  This includes the source of the
  DataMaskingFilterClass.  Please let me know if the link is not working for you
  and I will fix it.


  If you plan on implementing this data masking servlet filter, then I would
  also suggest <a
  href="http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/servlet-filters/response-compression-with-custom-servlet-filters/">implementing
  this compression servlet filter</a> as well.  If you plan implementing both of
  these, then make sure that you make the compression filter be the first filter
  specified in the web.xml's filter chain.


  Please let me know if you have any other question.
