  Hi Alexei,


  Thank you very much for listening to the podcast and commenting here.  


  I definitely need to look at what the web profile component is doing to
  communicate config data to the web server.  This would teach me the best
  practice for communicating information from the application to the web
  server. 
   
  Meanwhile, I have come up with a way to successfully communicate information
  from the application to the web server, but it is not necessarily ideal.  What
  I have done is created a JSP page on the web server that accepts an HTTP post
  and stores the posted data to a directory on the web server.  I am able to
  post data to this JSP page from a PeopleSoft component with the use of
  Integration Broker.  As I said, not ideal, but it does successfully
  communicate the information.


  I have found the bigger challenge to be the storage of the data on the web
  server and not so much the communication.  The data needs to be stored in a
  cached state so that the filter can reference the cached data in every call to
  the dofilter method.  Reading in the config data in the init method of the
  filter is not a viable option because a web server bounce would be required
  every time a change is made to the config data.  I am currently working on
  creating a cache manager in Java.  I will be sure to document my progress
  here.


  Thanks,

  Colton
