  Hi Karthik,


  This post was to demonstrate the capabilities of servlet filter-based data
  masking in PeopleSoft.  I do not have available a single bundled tool that
  provides all of this functionality, but I have made several posts
  (http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/category/servlet-filters/) on this site that
  demonstrates most all of the needed pieces to get this to work. Please let me
  know if you have any other questions.
