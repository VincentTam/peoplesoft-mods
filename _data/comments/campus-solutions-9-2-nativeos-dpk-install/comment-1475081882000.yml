  Hi Raghu,


  I do not have any experience with the Virtual Box install option so I cannot
  comment on the errors that you are getting with that. I am also not sure with
  how to create a control file or how you can pickup on the database creation
  step of the native OS DPK install option.  If you run puppet apply again and
  keep getting the same error, then I would suggest doing a clean uninstall and
  starting over.
