  Hi David,


  I believe that I ran into this problem as well.  You will need to modify the
  security properties of the pt folder (C:\psft\pt).  


  Right click the pt folder and select properties. Go to the security tab, click
  the user name that you are logged in as, and click the edit button. Here you
  can check the "allow" checkbox to give your account full control.  This should
  solve your problem. Please let me know if this doesn't work.


  Thanks,

  Colton
