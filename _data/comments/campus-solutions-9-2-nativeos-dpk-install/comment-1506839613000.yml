  Hi Raja.  To be honest, I am not too sure if the antivirus software is
  preventing the services from running.  I would suggest that you try running
  the installation scripts again with the antivirus software disabled.  Ensure
  that you get no errors during the installation process and then see if the
  services will run after the install.  At that point, you could re enable the
  antivirus software and see if the services work or not.
