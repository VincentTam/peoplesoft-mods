  When I did my testing with this project I did not find that the user could
  bypass the 2FA page in that manner.  When you attempt to access a different
  URL from the 2FA page, the sign on PeopleCode fires again.  The sign on
  PeopleCode sees that you do not have the 2FA token so it redirects you back to
  the 2FA page.  Please let me know if your findings are different.
