  I'm running tools 8.55.17 and when I login I get the custom page, but the
  PeopleCode doesn't seem to be firing.  If I select email or text nothing pops
  up. If I login first and navigate to the 2FA page via menu it does work, so
  not sure what the difference is.  Also I am able to specify a different page
  in the address bar and get there, but I think that's because no PeopleCode. 
  Any thoughts on what may cause this?
