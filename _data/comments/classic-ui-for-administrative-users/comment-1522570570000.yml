  For the most part, I believe your proposed use case will work.  The only
  problem is that if you set the HPPC PeopleTools Personalization Option to
  Classic, then you lose the ability to use Event Mapping to inject the
  redirection code into PT_LANDINGPAGE Component.  If you set the HPPC value to
  Classic, then when any user clicks the Home link I believe they will be taken
  to the Classic Homepage (Something Like .../EMPLOYEE/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT).  I
  am not sure how you would be able to conditionally redirect a Fluid user to
  the Fluid Homepage at that point.


  Instead, I would recommend setting the HPPC value to Fluid and then using the
  demonstrated Event Mapping technique to redirect the Classic users to the
  Classic Homepage.  This may not be desirable if the majority of users are
  "Classic Users", but it should work nonetheless.  Also, you are correct in
  that the HPTYPE URL parameter would be "F" instead of "C" if you want to land
  someone on the Fluid Homepage instead of the Classic one.


  Please let me know if you have any more questions and I will be happy to help
  you out.
