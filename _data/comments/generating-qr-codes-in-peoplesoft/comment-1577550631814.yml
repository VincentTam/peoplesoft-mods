message: "Hello Saim.  Are you making a change to the PSM_QRCODE_SVG HTML object via App Designer?  There is a bug in App Designer where it re formats and corrupts large HTML objects.  You need to use the Branding Objects page in the PIA to overcome this issue.  I did a post that documents this issue here: https://www.peoplesoftmods.com/tips-and-tricks/managing-large-html-objects/\r\n\r\nYou should be able to use that page to edit the HTML object and bind in any information (Employee ID, etc.) into the generated QR code."
