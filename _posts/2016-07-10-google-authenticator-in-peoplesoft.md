This is a demonstration of my Google Authenticator implementation in PeopleSoft. Google Authenticator is a free service that can be used to implement two-step verification in applications to add an additional layer of security. I decided to leverage the event mapping framework in PeopleSoft to enforce the two-step verification process at the component level, but this solution could just as easily be integrated into the PeopleSoft login page/process. If you are interested in implementing Google Authenticator in your PeopleSoft applications, then you can read [how I implemented this project here](https://www.peoplesoftmods.com/2fa/implementing-google-authenticator-in-peoplesoft/).
