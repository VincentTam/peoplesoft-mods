I’d like to share a demonstration of a field-level data masking solution that I’ve created for PeopleSoft.  This project showcases a lot of the techniques that I have discussed throughout the year on this blog with respect to creating a secure PeopleSoft application with a good user experience.  This bolt-on solution provides a user interface to configure what fields to mask, the conditional ability for end users to unmask data, and a way to track the sensitive data exposure throughout the system.
