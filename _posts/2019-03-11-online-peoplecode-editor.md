In the past I've discussed how the [%Metadata Application Package](/tips-and-tricks/understanding-the-metadata-application-package/) can be used to programmatically manage PeopleTools objects.  I provided a POC project that allowed for [PeopleCode event editing](/tips-and-tricks/online-peoplecode-event-editor/) in the PIA and then went on to show how the ACE editor can be used to provide [PeopleCode syntax highlighting](/tips-and-tricks/peoplecode-syntax-highlighting-in-ace-editor/).  

I've been working on fusing all of these ideas together to create an Online PeopleCode Editor. This project is _far_ from where I would like it to be, but I think it is in a position to provide at least some benefit to the community.  You can check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coltonfischer/ps-web-ide) to download the project and click the below [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99JV-53VFkQ) to understand the functionality that it has to offer.
